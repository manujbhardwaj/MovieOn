## Project

The team built a project utilizing:

* [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/)
* [Boostrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Spring Data JPA](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/)

The team built an e-commerce application allowing users to buy DVD copies from sellers.

We have five different types of user in our application.

* Admin: App has an admin user already created. Admin will be able to approve/reject the seller and critic. Unless approved Seller and Critic wont have access to sell and review movies respectively. Users can contact admin and write a note to the Admin. Admin can view the notes and take operations accordingly. 
* Buyer: Buyers will be able to chose and buy movie DVDs from a list of sellers. A buyer can further like/unlike a movie and add/remove a movie to their wishlist. A buyer can mark a seller as favorite. Buyer can also post reviews for specific sellers. A buyer will be able to add review for a particular seller.
* Seller: Sellers will be able to add selected movies to their inventory. The inventory will contain the movie list along with the number of copies of each movie.
* Critic: Critic can add reviews for a particular movie which will be visible to other users on the movie page.
* Anonymous User: Anonymous user can browse and search movies and get movie details but they wont be able to buy, like, wishlist a movie and add reviews for seller.
* In addition every user can do login, contact admin, search for a movie, add or update address and phone.
